# namedColors

This repository is my first attempt at creating a composer package. Its goal will be to allow to find a color's hexadecimal value from its name.

I intent to list all HTML colors, but also all the colors listed in the [W3Schools pages](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp).

FYI, I will use [Junior Grossi's tutorial](http://blog.jgrossi.com/2013/creating-your-first-composer-packagist-package/).
