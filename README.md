# Contributing

Feel free to add your own color schemes, as soon as they meet these requirements :
 
 - All colors schemes should be created in the `src/colors` directory
 - They must only contain one array, named `$colors`
 - Each item of this array must have one key, and these three values :
   - reference
   - name
   - hexa
 - The key should be a camelCase version of the color's name
 - `reference` and `name` are not mandatory
 - The `hexa` key is mandatory, it should contain the hexadecimal value of the color, prefixed with a sharp (`#`).
